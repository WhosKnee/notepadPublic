Notepad Web Application
 
This Application is a fully deployed web app that you can access via: https://still-sands-55485.herokuapp.com/
 
The purpose of this application was for me to personally experiment with different web development aspects that I have learned with respect
to both Front End and Back End applications. This application uses NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB as the main packages on the Stack.
The Web App is fully functional and responsive, so it is also mobile friendly!

Have fun using this application, would love to hear feedback about things I can do to improve the application.

Cheers!
